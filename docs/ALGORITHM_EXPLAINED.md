# Algorithm Explained

> **Note:** This documentation will be completed in Phase 05 (Polish phase) once all hand evaluation algorithms are implemented.

## Purpose

This document will provide detailed explanations of the poker hand evaluation algorithms used in this project, including:

- Hand ranking methodology
- Lookup table optimizations
- Comparison algorithms
- Performance characteristics

## Status

ðŸš§ **To be added in Phase 05** - This placeholder establishes the documentation structure early, with content to be added as features are completed.
